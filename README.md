# Portfolio-Danyon

## Description

In this project, I have built  myself my own personal portfolio from the ground up using the HTML and advanced CSS skills I have learnt so far.

My Motivation: To continue to prove that I am learning and developing an awesome new set of skills.

My did I build this?: I am in need of a personal portfolio to show of the work I have completed. Over the course of my studies, I will add future projects to this portfolio and develop it further, using new skills and tools to improve upon what I have created here.

What Problem does this solve?: I was lacking a centralised point to display my projects for people to view. This provides me with that point.

What did I learn: So many valuable things about CSS, such as Media Queries and Flexbox, and cool tricks such as the hover selector.
